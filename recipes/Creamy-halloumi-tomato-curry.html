    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Enjoy halloumi in this family-friendly curry â€“ it has a wonderful texture, similar to paneer. You may want to halve the amount of garam masala for young children</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        225g block halloumi<br>
        2 tbsp flavourless oil (such as vegetable or sunflower oil)<br>
        1 large onion, chopped<br>
        2 garlic cloves, crushed<br>
        thumb-sized piece of ginger, grated<br>
        2 tsp ground cumin<br>
        2 tsp ground coriander<br>
        1 tsp turmeric<br>
        400g can chopped tomatoes<br>
        100ml double cream<br>
        80g fresh or frozen baby spinach<br>
        2 tsp sugar<br>
        1 tbsp garam masala<br>
        1 tsp nigella seeds<br>
        cooked rice, grains or naan, to serve<br>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <h3>STEP 1</h3>
        Cut the halloumi into bite-sized cubes and set them aside. Heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a large pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and cook for about 5 mins, or until it turns translucent.

        <h3>STEP 2</h3>
        Add the garlic and ginger to the pan. Cook for another 2 mins, stirring frequently, until they become fragrant. Stir in the cumin, coriander and turmeric, and cook for 2 mins more. Pour in the tomatoes and stir well. Simmer for 5-7 mins, or until the mixture thickens.

        <h3>STEP 3</h3>
        Reduce the heat and add the cream. Stir and simmer gently for 3-4 mins until thickened.

        <h3>STEP 4</h3>
        While the sauce is simmering, heat the remaining 1 tbsp oil in a separate pan over a medium-high heat. Fry the halloumi for 3-4 mins until golden brown on all sides.

        <h3>STEP 5</h3>
        Once the halloumi is browned, add it to the sauce along with the spinach, sugar and garam masala and stir to combine. Gently simmer for 5 mins until the spinach has wilted or defrosted. If the curry seems too thick, add a splash of water or more cream to loosen it. Scatter with nigella seeds and serve with rice, grains or naan.
