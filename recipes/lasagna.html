        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            2 olive oil, plus extra for the dish<br>
            750g lean beef mince<br>
            90g pack prosciutto<br>
            800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce<br>
            200ml hot beef stock<br>
            nutmeg<br>
            300g fresh lasagne sheets<br>

            <h2>Method</h2>

            <h3>STEP 1</h3>
            <p>To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and cook 750g lean beef mince in two batches for about 10 mins until browned all over.</p>

            <h3>STEP 2</h3>
            <p>Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g pack, then stir through the meat mixture.</p>

            <h3>STEP 3</h3>
            <p>Pour over 800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe and 200ml hot beef stock. Add a little grated nutmeg, then season.</p>

            <h3>STEP 4</h3>
            <p>Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until the sauce looks rich.</p>

            <h3>STEP 5</h3>
            <p>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish (about 30 x 20cm).</p>

            <h3>STEP 6</h3>
            <p>Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with some fresh lasagne sheets from a 300g pack. Drizzle over roughly 130g ready-made or homemade white sauce.</p>

            <h3>STEP 7</h3>
            <p>Repeat until you have three layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining 390g white sauce, making sure you canâ€™t see any pasta poking through.</p>

            <h3>STEP 8</h3>
            <p>Scatter 125g torn mozzarella over the top.</p>

            <h3>STEP 9</h3>
            <p>Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top. Bake for 45 mins until the top is bubbling and lightly browned.</p>
