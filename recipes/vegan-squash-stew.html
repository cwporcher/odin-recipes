    <h3>ingredents</h3>
    <ul>
    2 tbsp rapeseed oil<br>
    320g large chestnut mushrooms, quartered<br>
    2 bay leaves<br>
    2 tbsp fresh rosemary<br>
    4 red onions, quartered<br>
    4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced<br>
    320g prepared butternut squash<br>
    600ml vegetable stock, made with 1 tbsp bouillon powder<br>
    2 x 400g cans chickpeas, drained<br>
    1 tbsp smoked paprika<br>
    
    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <h4>STEP 1</h4>
        Heat the oil in a large non-stick pan over a medium heat and fry the mushrooms, bay and rosemary for about 5 mins. Tip in the onions and garlic, and cook for a few minutes more until softened.

        <h4>STEP 2</h4>
        Add the butternut squash, stock, chickpeas, smoked paprika and tomato pur√©e. Cover and simmer for 40 minutes until the liquid has reduced to a thick gravy.

        <h4>STEP 3</h4>
        About 25 mins before the end of cooking time, make the mash. Bring a large pan of water to the boil and cook the swede for 5 mins, then add the potatoes and boil for 15-20 mins until tender. Drain and mash with plenty of black pepper.

        <h4>Step 5</h4>
        Serve half the stew and mash now, then chill the rest to reheat and eat another day. Will keep chilled for up to three days. Reheat the stew in a pan until piping hot. The mash can be reheated in the microwave. Serve with broccoli and peas, if you like.
